    <h1 class="about">About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Nicholas Ross, and I'm passionate about technology. With 2 years of experience learning about programming and project management, I've developed a deep expertise in Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I hold a bachelorâ€™s of Science in Computer Systems Technology from Illinois State University, where I cultivated my love for computers. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on exciting projects such as arduino Bluetooth race car, which allowed me to program, build, and test out my creation.
        Outside of work, I enjoy movies, drawing, music, and traveling, which helps me stay creative and balanced. I'm also an avid gamer, and I love sports.
        I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, share ideas, or just chat about a topic.
